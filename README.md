# WELCOME!!

This was my first react project!

It was kind of my "Hello Word" using React.

It was pretty simple, but it was a project that I've made in the course I was taking.

Notes:
- All codes inside the Components folder and also the App, Index and CSS were developed by me.

- The ESlint, images and data were provided by Trybe (the school witch I'm studying).

Thanks a lot for taking a look! you're very welcome to spy on all my others repositories!
